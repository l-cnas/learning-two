    <h1>Helldivers 2</h1>
    <h2>Arrowhead Game Studios</h2>
    <p>Helldivers 2 is a chaotic, team-based sci-fi shooter where players<br>
        act as elite soldiers fighting to defend “Super Earth” from alien<br>
        threats across hostile planets. It emphasizes cooperation, friendly<br>
        fire realism, and coordinated strategy — every mission contributes to a<br>
        shared galactic war effort led by the player community.
