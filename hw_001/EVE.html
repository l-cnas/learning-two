    <h1>EVE Online</h1>
    <h2>CCP Games</h2>
    <p>EVE Online is a massive space-based MMORPG set in a persistent, player-driven universe.

        Players pilot customizable ships to mine, trade, explore, manufacture, fight pirates, or engage in large-scale
        PvP wars and politics. The entire in-game economy, corporations (guilds), and territorial control are run by
        players, leading to real-world-scale battles, espionage, and alliances.

        In short — it’s about freedom, economy, and power struggles in a single shared galaxy.
